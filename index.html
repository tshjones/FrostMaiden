      <p>Icewind Dale has become trapped in a perpetual winter. Ferocious blizzards make the pass through the Spine of the World exceedingly trecherous, and the land has not felt the wamth of the sun in over a year. 
        In fact, the sun no longer appears above the mountains, not even in what should be the height of summer. 
        In this frozen tundra, darkness and bitter cold reign as king and queen. Most Dale residents blame Auril the Frostmiaden, the god of Winter's wrath. The shimmering aurora that weaves across the sky each clear night is said to be her doing.</p>
      <p>Dalefolk live in a scattering of settlements known as Ten-Towns. The drop-off in caravans coming from the South and travel between settlements in this never-ending winter has left everyone feeling isolated. 
        Although each town has resolved to appease the Frostmaiden with sacrifices of one kind or another, no respite from winter's fury seems forthcoming. 
        For adventurers such as yourself, Ten-Towns is a place to test one's mettle and, in the spirit of heroes who have come before, leave one's mark on this frigid, blinghted land.</P>
